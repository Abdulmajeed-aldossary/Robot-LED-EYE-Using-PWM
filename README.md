# Robot-LED-EYE-Using-PWM
In this task, we will control LED with pulse width modulation (PWM). advantages of using PWM is to have high efficiency, maintain color and temperature of the LED, Avoidance of color shifts by operating the LED at its proposed forward current and forward voltage operating point.
